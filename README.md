A group photo sharing application written in react native

### Main Screens

Our main home screen is in __HomeScreen.js__.
This screen shows our photo feed and allows for filtering of the photos based on their group.
This screen also handles opening the photo view pop-up and the post photo pop-up.

All Firebase functionality is in __Firebase.js__

__photoview.js__ handles showing a specific photo and also handling showing or 
hiding comments, where a user can make a comment on a post.
